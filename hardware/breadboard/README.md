# Breadboard circuit and layout

This project was used to define a slightly modified circuit for implementation on solderless
breadboards, and to plan the layout of the components.  It combines the CPU and I/O modules, but has
some parts removed which are only relevant to the PCB version such as I/O expansion sockets.

The PCB layout editor shows the positioning of the components on the breadboard, but not the connections between them.
